I'm a Stanford student and cryptonetwork enthusiast. I'm currently pursuing
coterminal BS and MS degrees in Computer Science, concentrating in AI and
computer and network security respectively. I'm a huge believer in
decentralized networks and their potential to change how our world works. 

I previously worked at Andreessen Horowitz and as research assistant in the Stanford Program on Energy and Sustainable Development.
