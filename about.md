Hey, I'm Guy.

The kind of person who likes taking things apart and understanding their intricate
details. These days I work on cryptonetworks. I'm interested in how people organize and
communicate, and I believe in markets.

At Stanford I studied AI in hopes of replicating Daryl Morey, Billy Beane, and Sam Hinke.
Even though I grew up in suburban Philadelphia, I'm still a diehard Boston Celtics fan.
Somewhere in the middle, I discovered Bitcoin and fell down the rabbit hole.
I'm a huge believer in the power of decentralized networks and their potential to
change how our world works. I'm also fascinated by the Internet. Never before has
a single medium contained so much human knowledge and connection. I believe the
Internet is still in it's infancy and can grow to make the world a more empathetic
and just place.

I'm fortunate to work on the team at a16z crypto. If you're interested in cryptonetworks
and the future of the Internet, please give me a shout.
